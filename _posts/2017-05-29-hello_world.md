Hello world and welcome to this place!

This is my first post, it will serves 2 main purposes. Firstly, for myself as a test post, and secondly, for you, the reader. This is my personal blog, I'll write articles about the stuff I do, the stuff I try, mainly research in IT security, maybe other topics. I just need to explain some things to people and express myself!

Let's make a short presentation, my name is Emy, but I am more active under the nickname "ark" on the internet. I am a freshly diplomed student from Epitech (France) and the University of Kent (United Kingdom), and curently work on industrial automotive security. I am curious of all things, and like to try out new stuff regularly.

Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy what I do, see you in a next article!

ark.
